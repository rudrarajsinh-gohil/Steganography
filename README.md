# Steganography
- Steganography is a cybersecurity technique used to protect sensitive messages by embedding them within other digital files, such as images, audio, or video.
- This method ensures covert communication. Unlike encryption, which highlights the presence of hidden data, steganography conceals the very existence of the message, making it an effective tool against cyber threats and surveillance.
- Integrating steganography with modern cryptographic techniques enhances data confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against unauthorized access, making it a crucial asset in cybersecurity.
