# Steganography
Steganography is a cybersecurity technique used to protect sensitive messages by embedding them within other digital files, such as images, audio, or video, ensuring covert communication. Unlike encryption, which draws attention to hidden data, steganography conceals the very existence of the message, making it an effective tool against cyber threats and surveillance. This project explores various steganographic methods, including Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding, frequency-domain techniques, and AI-driven steganography, to enhance security and minimize detection risks. By integrating steganography with modern cryptographic techniques, this approach strengthens data confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against unauthorized access, making it a crucial asset in cybersecurity.
