#Steganography
- Steganography is a cybersecurity technique used to protect sensitive messages by embedding them within other digital files, such as images, audio, or video, ensuring covert communication.
- Unlike encryption, which draws attention to hidden data, steganography conceals the very existence of the message, making it an effective tool against cyber threats and surveillance.
- This project explores various steganographic methods to enhance security and minimize detection risks. Integrating steganography with modern cryptographic techniques strengthens data confidentiality, integrity, and resilience against unauthorized access, making it a 
  crucial asset in cybersecurity.
