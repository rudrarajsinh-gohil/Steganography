🛡️ Steganography for Secure Communication
Steganography is a cybersecurity technique that hides secret messages within ordinary files like images, audio, or video, ensuring covert and secure communication. Unlike encryption, which makes data unreadable, steganography conceals the existence of the message itself, making it nearly impossible to detect.

✨ Key Features
🔹 LSB Encoding – Hides data within image pixels invisibly
🔹 Audio & Video Steganography – Embeds messages into multimedia files
🔹 AI-Enhanced Steganography – Leverages deep learning for stronger concealment
🔹 Multi-Layer Security – Combine steganography with encryption for added protection

⚙️ How It Works
🖼️ Choose a cover file – Image, audio, or video
📥 Embed the secret message – Using steganographic techniques
📤 Send the modified file – Securely and discreetly
🔍 Extract the hidden message – With the decoding algorithm

🔐 Use Cases
✅ Secure communication – Protect sensitive information
✅ Covert data storage – Hide messages in plain sight
✅ Bypass censorship – Communicate without raising suspicion
✅ Digital watermarking – Authenticate media ownership
